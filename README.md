# Work Day Scheduler 

This Application allows users to edit and save events for each hour of the workday. Perfect for an employee with a busy schedule to help keep track of important tasks. 

When the application is opened, the current date will display at the top of the page and just below it will be an agenda with time blocks between 9AM and 5PM, one block for every hour.

Time blocks in the past will appear grey, time blocks within the current hour will appear red, and time blocks in the future will appear green. 

The user can click inside the time block and input whatever tasks need to be done at that time, then click the save button when they are done.

Screenshots of the application are below.
